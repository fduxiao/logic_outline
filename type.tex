\chapter{Type Theory}
\label{type-theory}

In this chapter, I mainly describe a basic language like set theory.
The semantics of first-order language is strongly connected to sets.
Every first-order formula represents a kind of set operation.
For example, we can prove a group of order prime squared is abelian.
Let me first formalize it in first order logic. The language should
have been $\mathscr{L}=(\cdot)$

The axioms are
$$
\Gamma = \{
    \forall a b, c
\}
$$
